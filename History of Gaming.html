        <h3>Beginning of Gaming</h3>

    <p>The history of gaming stretches really far, even before there was electronics, gaming still technically existed.
        Board games like chess or checkers, playing cards etc. all tie into the history of gaming. Getting into
        electronics, computing has been around longer than video gaming and it has a big part of it. One of the first
        video games was Nim, in which players try not to pick up the last matchstick, this was in 1940. This is the
        beginning of gaming, throughout 1940 and 1960 is roughly where video games are starting to be made well basic
        ones. In 1950 Claude Shannon shared the basics on how to program a computer to play chess. Through the 1950s
        many people are programming computers to play different types of games. Some games made during the 50s were
        tic-tac-toe, blackjack, checkers, chess, tennis, and Mouse Maze. Most of the games made in the 50s were computer
        programs, examples would be tic-tac-toe and checkers. Moving into the 60s this is still where programmers are
        making games on computers but also starting to make things like the Brown Box made by Ralph Baer which is used
        for just video games. In the 60s many people are programming games on computers. Some games made were a baseball
        simulation game, some war games, and football. Ralph Baer is a very important person because of his invention
        the Brown Box, “Four years later Magnavox releases Odyssey, the first home video game system, based on his
        designs” (Smith, 2014).</p>

    <h3>Early Modern</h3>

    <p>Getting into the 1970s this is where video games start developing beyond computers. In 1972 Nolan Bushnell and
        Al Alcorn developed Pong which was a very famous arcade game at time and still is iconic. Through the 70s and
        80s is where video games develop a lot, for example one of the most famous in home gaming console, Atari 2600
        is released in 1977. In 1980 one of the most iconic games in history starts being sold which is Pac-Man.
        During the 70s and 80s video games are just becoming more popular and better, in the 80s is where big video
        games come out such as Donkey Kong, Tetris, Zelda and Madden. In 1985 Nintendo released the NES which could
        play many games like Mario and Duck Hunt. One big gaming product that came out was the Gameboy which wasn’t
        the first handheld gaming device “but with its good game play, ease of use, and long battery life” (Smith) it
        became very popular.</p>

    <h3>Modern</h3>

    <p>The modern age of gaming starts in the 90s, the video games in the 90s might have not been as sophisticated as
        they are today but this is when the modern age of gaming began.  In the 90s Sonic the Hedgehog is made for
        Sega Genesis, Mortal Kombat is made, in 1994 Sony releases PlayStation which is a huge console in the present
        (PlayStation 4). Another huge gaming console is released which was Xbox in 2001, now in the 21st  century many
        video game consoles and video games are being released. Some big consoles released are Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,
        Wii, also one big thing made was steam where pc gamer can buy and download games. There are far too many
        consoles and videos games made in the 21st  century to continue but thanks to computers video games were made,
        that’s some of the history of video games.</p>
